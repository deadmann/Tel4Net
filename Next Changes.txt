Dialing Code exceptions: https://www.iban.com/dialing-codes
Not all country or region use the 00 as country code prefix. we sometime need to check other numbers too. these exceptions should be applied in the phone validator too.

Fortunately the + sign is same, everywhere, and won't affect telephone number.
